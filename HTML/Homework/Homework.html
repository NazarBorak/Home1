    <h1>Ryan Gosling</h1>


    <h2>Early life</h2>
    <p> <b>Ryan Thomas Gosling</b> was born in London, Ontario,[2] the son of Thomas Ray Gosling, a travelling salesman for
        a paper mill,[3] and Donna, a secretary.[4][5] Both of his parents are of part French-Canadian descent, along
        with some German, English, Scottish, and Irish.[6][7] Gosling's parents were Mormons,[8] and Gosling has said
        that the religion influenced every aspect of their lives.[9] However, he said he "never really could identify
        with [Mormonism]."[10] Because of his father's work, they "moved around a lot"[3] and Gosling lived in both
        Cornwall, Ontario,[11] and Burlington, Ontario.[12] His parents divorced when he was 13,[13] and he and his
        older sister Mandi lived with their mother,[4] an experience Gosling has credited with programming him "to
        think like a girl".[14]

        Gosling was educated at Gladstone Public School,[15] Cornwall Collegiate and Vocational School and Lester B.
        Pearson High School.[16] As a child, he watched Dick Tracy and was inspired to become an actor.[17] He "hated"
        being a child,[9][18] was bullied in elementary school[19] and had no friends until he was "14 or 15".[20][21]
        In grade one, having been heavily influenced by the action film First Blood, he took steak knives to school
        and threw them at other children during recess. This incident led to a suspension.[18] He was unable to read,
        [22] and was evaluated for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but was not diagnosed with it and,
        contrary to false reports, never took medication.[23] His mother left her job and homeschooled him for a year.
        [24] Gosling has said that homeschooling gave him "a sense of autonomy that I've never really lost".[9] Gosling
        performed in front of audiences from an early age, encouraged by his sister being a performer.[25] He and his
        sister sang together at weddings; he performed with Elvis Perry, his uncle's Elvis Presley tribute act,[26] and
        was involved with a local ballet company.[27] Performing boosted his self-confidence as it was the only thing
        for which he received praise.[21] He developed an idiosyncratic accent because, as a child, he thought having a
        Canadian accent did not sound "tough". He began to model his accent on that of Marlon Brando.[28] He dropped
        out of high school at the age of 17 to focus on his acting career.[29]</p>

                    “The Believer” explores a Jewish student’s private journey to understand the meaning of Judaism in his
                    life. Set in New York City, the Plot follows a morally confused young adult struggling with the conflict
                    between his beliefs and his heritage. “The Believer” examines themes of religion, family, and
                    self-loathing. It is a psychological examination into the forces of intolerance, both on the individual
                    and society as a whole.
